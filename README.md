# SFM ("Simulated File System")
By: Raymond Lind
### SFM is a Simulated File System made with Python. 
##### Directories will be green, meaning you can cd into them.
##### Files will be white, meaning their an endpoint.
# Program Usage
Make a directory:
```
mkdir "DirectoryName"
```
Make a file:
```
touch "FileName"
```
List content in current directory:
```
ls
```
Open Directory:
```
cd "DirectoryName"
```
Shows commands with their actions:
```
help
```
Shows commands and how to use them:
```
usage
```

# Set-up

### If using in your own interpreter:
Copy code from SFM.py and paste into your file.

### If using in Linux/Ubuntu:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Raymond-Lind/SFM
```
# Important

This is a File System stored in memory. Meaning any directories or files made in the program will disappear after the program is closed.
Users should remember this throughout the duration of the script.

## Extra

If you want to have a simpler version of code without advanced user features or don't enjoy the colors in code, you can use SFM_nocolor.py

Enjoy!
